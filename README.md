# mfa-mcu-demo
A lightweight demonstration of multi-factor authentication (MFA) using a microcontroller (MCU) for social media login.  The project simulates a simple second-factor mechanism using an ESP32 or Arduino-based device that verifies user identity through physical input (like a timed button press or fingerprint).
